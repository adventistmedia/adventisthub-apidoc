# Endpoints

After a successful sign in to the application there are several endpoints you may want to call first up. This includes:

* Show Account - read the users basic details
* List Teams - read which teams the user has memberships to
* Show Membership - read the users role within the current team

The following endpoints provide defaults that are used throughout the App:

* List Approaches
* List Brands
* List Campaigns
* List Categories
* List Languages
* List Religions
* List Studies

Additional endpoints you may like to call initially:

* List Alerts - read all alerts currently active for the user

Ready, steady, here come the endpoints...
